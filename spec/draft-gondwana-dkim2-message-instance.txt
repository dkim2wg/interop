               A method for describing changes to emails
                draft-gondwana-dkim2-message-instance-00

Abstract

   This memo describes a method for describing the changes made to an
   email during common email modifications, for example those caused by
   mailing lists and forwarders.

   While this is general enough to be used for any changes, it is
   anticipated that this method will normally be used for removing added
   data rather than large complex changes.

   This method also captures hashes of important features of the
   message, allowing validation that the changes were described
   correctly, and allowing a signature which covers the Message-Instance
   header to, by extention, ensure that the important content of the
   message is unchanged.

   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Background and motivations

   Currently, when an email is sent with a DKIM signature, the message
   can go through multiple forwarders and still be authenticated,
   however if a single change is made to a header which is covered by
   the signature, or to the body, then the signature no longer validates
   - and it's impossible for the receiver to know what was changed, or
   even if the entire message was replaced.

   By producing a way to describe changes, the recipient can examine the
   sections which were changed and determine whether the change was
   malicious.  By undoing the changes, it is possible to recreate a
   message which matches the original signature, and hence provide
   accountability for the content which was present in the copy of the
   message to which the signature was applied.

2.  The Message-Instance Header Field

   This document describes an ordered set of header fields, each of
   which describes the message at a specific version, along with
   instructions on how to convert that version back to the previous
   version.

   To well formed, a message must have a monotonically increasing set of
   Message-Instance header fields, with the first having mi=1 and each
   having an increasing integer number, with no gaps.

2.1.  Message-Instance Header

   The format of the value is a tag-list.  Tag-lists contain key=value;
   key2=value2; - they can be wrapped, and all whitespace is normalised
   to a single space.

   TODO: we need to specify tag-list.

   individual MIME parts, and hh.n.m to hash the headers of the MIME
   part as well?

2.2.  body-recipe

   The Body Recipe is a comma separated list of instructions.  Each
   instruction starts with a prefix.  Commas can be followed by optional
   whitespace.

   The presence of a recipe replaces the previous value, so the tag-
   value b= creates an empty body, while the tag-value b=b: creates a
   message with a single blank line for the body.

2.3.  header-recipe

   The Header Recipe is a comma separated list of instructions.  Each
   instruction starts with a prefix.  Commas can be followed by optional
   whitespace.

   While key names are case insensitive, implementations SHOULD create
   the header with the same case as the key.

   The presence of a recipe removes every instance of the named header
   field before applying the recipe, so the tag-value h.foo= removes all
   instances of Foo from the message.

                                  Table 3

   NOTE: the headers are inserted from the bottom, i.e. prepended to the
   message in the order that they are named.

   e.g. given a message with headers:

   Foo: three
   Foo: two
   Foo: one

   And the recipe: h.Foo=c:1-1,b:Zm91cg==,c:2-3

   The output will be: ~~~ Foo: three Foo: two Foo: four Foo: one ~~~

2.4.  Examples

   Example for a message which has had Subject and From replaced, and
   Reply-To added.

   From: brong@fastmailteam.com.dmarc.fail
   To: dkim2@lists.ietf.org
   Reply-To: dkim2@lists.ietf.org
   Message-Instance: mi=2;
    h.Subject=b:QSByZXBsYWNlbWVudCBmb3IgREtJTQ==;
    h.From=b:YnJvbmdAZmFzdG1haWx0ZWFtLmNvbQo=;
    h.Reply-To=

   Example:

   Message-Instance: mi=3; b=c:1-500,c:520-520

   Example - a URL was substituted in the content of the body (complex,
   but still easily doable!)

  Message-Instance: mi=4;
   b=c:1-500,
     b:PGEgaHJlZj0iaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iPkV4YW1wbGU8L2E+Cg==,
     c:501-702

   It is expected that 'c' will normally be used to copy lines directly
   from the new message, however in cases where a message needs to
   transit 7-bit systems cleanly, the email modifier may need to re-
   encode the octets of the original message, and this allows for doing
   so, albeit at some expense in header bloat!

3.  Calculating the hh value

   The algorithm for calculating the hh value is to iterate through the
   header names in the h= field and add each header field which matches
   that name with a case insignificant comparison, starting from the
   bottom (all header-fields start from the bottom and count upwards).
   This uses the 'relaxed' algorithm described in [DKIM] section 2.4.3
   for headers, lowercasing field names, and normalising whitespace in
   header bodies, with a trailing CRLF.  These values are added to the
   digest.

   The final 'hh=' value includes all the listed headers in the h=
   field, and nothing else.  There are no implicit fields included.  ALL
   copies of every named header field is included.  If a later Message-
   Instance is created where the header fields named in an earlier
   Message-Instance are changed, it MUST describe how to get back to the
   previous values, or affirmatively declare (with 'z') that it isn't
   doing so.

   These headers are fed in order to the algorithm specified by the a=
   tag value, encoding the result as base64.

Internet-Draft        Email Modification Versioning        November 2025


4.  Calculating the bh value

   The algorithm for calculating the bh value is to process all the
   lines of the body with the relaxed algorithm declared in [DKIM]
   section 3.4.4, feeding them in order to the algorithm specified by
   the a= tag value, and encoding the result as base64.

5.  Calculating the ph.x.y values

   For each MIME part following the algorithm used in [IMAP] section
   6.4.5.1, decode the content as a binary data stream after performing
   decoding as described by the section's Content-Transfer-Encoding, and
   feed it to the algorithm specified by the a= tag value, encoding the
   result as base64.

6.  Iterative application

   To get back to the original message and confirm that it was
   unchanged, it is necessary to apply this algorith iteratively.

   For example if you receive a message for which there is a
   modification to the headers at mi=3 and a modification to both
   headers and body at mi=2, to recreate the original message you would
   first apply the header changes from mi=3, then apply the header and
   body changes for mi=2.  If this doesn't create a message which
   validates with the initial mi=1 hash, then some hop has corrupted the
   message.

7.  Security

   Since a Message-Instance header can be used to recreate any email
   content, implementations need to be aware that this could be used to
   bypass security checks, and passing the generated message to a parser
   could expose it to content that would otherwise be blocked by earlier
   security checks, e.g. the base64 output could generate 8-bit content
   or NULL bytes that would otherwise be blocked by a simple filter.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add to the Permanent Message Header Field Names
   registry the following record.

   *  Header Field Name: Message-Instance

   *  Template:

   *  Protocol: mail

Appendix A.  Changes from Earlier Versions

A.1.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-message-instance-00

   *  what's in a name anyway?  People didn't like "Mail" in the IETF124
      meeting, and "Version" is confusing

   *  change mv= to mi=

   *  each header name covers ALL instances of that header name.

A.2.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-mailversion-00

   *  Rename this draft to "mailversion".

   *  Rename the header field to 'Message-Instance'

   *  Change 'v=' to 'mv=' so it matches DKIM2-Signature and doesn't
      confuse protocol versions

   *  Removed 't:' optional fields entirely.

   *  Added ha= to select the hash algorithm and documentation about how
      the hashes are calculated

   *  Renamed bin.partspec to ph.partspec for "part hash" and described
      it with reference to IMAP.

   *  Added security considerations

Internet-Draft        Email Modification Versioning        November 2025


   *  Added IANA considerations

A.3.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-modification-algebra-03

   *  Rename header to 'MailVersion'

   *  Remove all requirements that it integrates with DKIM2.

   *  Add body hash and per-mime-part hashes (NOTE: this is a bunch of
      extra calculation, so definitely to discuss)

A.4.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-modification-algebra-02

   *  change the header format to have unique keys, making it fit the
      ABNF for these types of headers.

   *  allow easier editing of multi-value headers by always popping the
      first header and always prepending newly added headers.

   *  change body to use d.0, d.1, etc with the program in the value, so
      that the program ordering is reliable regardless of the parser
      used to read the header.

A.5.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-modification-algebra-02

   *  change to using line numbers rather than octet offsets

   *  remove d= base64 decoding capability

   *  for multiple lines; require a separate b= or t= for each line

A.6.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-modification-algebra-01

   *  rename 'DKIM2-Diff' headers to 'DKIM2-Delta'

   *  add 'z=y' option to DKIM2-Delta-Body for "complete replacement"

   *  add d= base64 decoding option to DKIM2-Delta-Body

A.7.  draft-gondwana-dkim2-modification-algebra-00

   *  original version
