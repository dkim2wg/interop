    <abstract>


<t>This memo describes a method for describing the changes made to an email
during common email modifications, for example those caused by mailing lists
and forwarders.</t>

<t>While this is general enough to be used for any changes, it is anticipated that
this method will normally be used for removing added data rather than large
complex changes.</t>

<t>This method also captures hashes of important features of the message,
allowing validation that the changes were described correctly, and allowing
a signature which covers the Message-Instance header to, by extention, ensure
that the important content of the message is unchanged.</t>



    </abstract>

<section anchor="background-and-motivations"><name>Background and motivations</name>

<t>Currently, when an email is sent with a DKIM signature, the message can go
through multiple forwarders and still be authenticated, however if a single
change is made to a header which is covered by the signature, or to the body,
then the signature no longer validates - and it's impossible for the receiver
to know what was changed, or even if the entire message was replaced.</t>

<t>By producing a way to describe changes, the recipient can examine the sections
which were changed and determine whether the change was malicious.  By undoing
the changes, it is possible to recreate a message which matches the original
signature, and hence provide accountability for the content which was present
in the copy of the message to which the signature was applied.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="the-message-instance-header-field"><name>The Message-Instance Header Field</name>

<t>This document describes an ordered set of header fields, each of
which describes the message at a specific version, along with
instructions on how to convert that version back to the previous
version.</t>

<t>To well formed, a message must have a monotonically increasing
set of Message-Instance header fields, with the first having mi=1
and each having an increasing integer number, with no gaps.</t>

<section anchor="message-instance-header"><name>Message-Instance Header</name>

<t>The format of the value is a tag-list.  Tag-lists contain key=value; key2=value2; - they can be wrapped,
and all whitespace is normalised to a single space.</t>

<t>TODO: we need to specify tag-list.</t>

      <c>Recipe to replicate the previous version of the named header field</c>
</texttable>

<t>TODO: do we want to add 'bh.n.m' to hash the un-decoded body of individual MIME parts,
and hh.n.m to hash the headers of the MIME part as well?</t>

</section>
<section anchor="body-recipe"><name>body-recipe</name>

<t>The Body Recipe is a comma separated list of instructions.  Each instruction starts with a
prefix.  Commas can be followed by optional whitespace.</t>

<t>The presence of a recipe replaces the previous value, so the tag-value <spanx style="verb">b=</spanx> creates an empty body, while the tag-value <spanx style="verb">b=b:</spanx> creates a message with a single blank line for the body.</t>

<texttable>
      <ttcol align='left'>Prefix</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Value</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Action</ttcol>
      <c>c:</c>
      <c>start-end</c>
      <c>Copy the lines (inclusive) numbered from 1.  E.g. "c:1-3" copies the first three lines.</c>
      <c>b:</c>
      <c>base64</c>
      <c>Decode the base64 to get the value of a line to insert.  The base64 value does NOT include the trailing CRLF, which must be added at the end of the line, hence "b:" means insert an empty line, and "b:SGVsbG8=" inserts the line "Hello".</c>
      <c>z</c>
      <c>none</c>
      <c>If present, says that changes have been made to the body which can not be described to get back to the earlier version, meaning the signing system takes accountability for the full content.</c>
</texttable>

</section>
<section anchor="header-recipe"><name>header-recipe</name>

<t>The Header Recipe is a comma separated list of instructions.  Each instruction starts with a
prefix.  Commas can be followed by optional whitespace.</t>

<t>While key names are case insensitive, implementations SHOULD create the header with the same
case as the key.</t>

<t>The presence of a recipe removes every instance of the named header field before applying the recipe,
so the tag-value <spanx style="verb">h.foo=</spanx> removes all instances of Foo from the message.</t>

<texttable>
      <ttcol align='left'>Prefix</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Value</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Action</ttcol>
      <c>c:</c>
      <c>start-end</c>
      <c>Copy the values of the header-fields with the indexes, numbered from 1 and starting at the bottom;</c>
      <c>b:</c>
      <c>base64</c>
      <c>Decode the base64 to get the value of a header field to insert. The base64 value does NOT include the trailing CRLF, which must be added at the end of the line, hence "b:" means insert a header-field with an empty value.</c>
      <c>z</c>
      <c>none</c>
      <c>If present, says that changes have been made to the named header field which can not be described to get back to the earlier version, meaning the signing system takes accountability for the full content of this message.</c>
</texttable>

<t>NOTE: the headers are inserted from the bottom, i.e. prepended to the message in the order that they are named.</t>

<t>e.g. given a message with headers:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Foo: three
Foo: two
Foo: one
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>And the recipe: <spanx style="verb">h.Foo=c:1-1,b:Zm91cg==,c:2-3</spanx></t>

<t>The output will be:
~~~
Foo: three
Foo: two
Foo: four
Foo: one
~~~</t>

</section>
<section anchor="examples"><name>Examples</name>

<t>Example for a message which has had Subject and From replaced,
and Reply-To added.</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
From: brong@fastmailteam.com.dmarc.fail
To: dkim2@lists.ietf.org
Reply-To: dkim2@lists.ietf.org
Message-Instance: mi=2;
 h.Subject=b:QSByZXBsYWNlbWVudCBmb3IgREtJTQ==;
 h.From=b:YnJvbmdAZmFzdG1haWx0ZWFtLmNvbQo=;
 h.Reply-To=
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Message-Instance: mi=3; b=c:1-500,c:520-520
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Example - a URL was substituted in the content of the body (complex, but still
easily doable!)</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Message-Instance: mi=4;
 b=c:1-500,
   b:PGEgaHJlZj0iaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20iPkV4YW1wbGU8L2E+Cg==,
   c:501-702
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>It is expected that 'c' will normally be used to copy lines directly from
the new message, however in cases where a message needs to transit 7-bit systems
cleanly, the email modifier may need to re-encode the octets of the original message,
and this allows for doing so, albeit at some expense in header bloat!</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="calculating-the-hh-value"><name>Calculating the hh value</name>

<t>The algorithm for calculating the hh value is to iterate through the header names in the
<spanx style="verb">h=</spanx> field and add each header field which matches that name with a case insignificant
comparison, starting from the bottom (all header-fields start from the bottom and count
upwards).  This uses the 'relaxed' algorithm described in <xref target="DKIM"/> section 2.4.3 for
headers, lowercasing field names, and normalising whitespace in header bodies, with
a trailing CRLF.  These values are added to the digest.</t>

<t>The final 'hh=' value includes all the listed headers in the h= field, and nothing
else.  There are no implicit fields included.  ALL copies of every named header field
is included.  If a later Message-Instance is created where the header fields named in
an earlier Message-Instance are changed, it MUST describe how to get back to the
previous values, or affirmatively declare (with 'z') that it isn't doing so.</t>

<t>These headers are fed in order to the algorithm specified by the a= tag value,
encoding the result as base64.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="calculating-the-bh-value"><name>Calculating the bh value</name>

<t>The algorithm for calculating the bh value is to process all the lines of the body
with the relaxed algorithm declared in <xref target="DKIM"/> section 3.4.4, feeding them in
order to the algorithm specified by the a= tag value, and encoding the result as base64.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="calculating-the-phxy-values"><name>Calculating the ph.x.y values</name>

<t>For each MIME part following the algorithm used in <xref target="IMAP"/> section 6.4.5.1, decode
the content as a binary data stream after performing decoding as described by
the section's <spanx style="verb">Content-Transfer-Encoding</spanx>, and feed it to the algorithm specified
by the a= tag value, encoding the result as base64.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iterative-application"><name>Iterative application</name>

<t>To get back to the original message and confirm that it was unchanged, it is necessary
to apply this algorith iteratively.</t>

<t>For example if you receive a message for which there is a modification to the
headers at <spanx style="verb">mi=3</spanx> and a modification to both headers and body at <spanx style="verb">mi=2</spanx>, to recreate the
original message you would first apply the header changes from <spanx style="verb">mi=3</spanx>, then apply the
header and body changes for <spanx style="verb">mi=2</spanx>.  If this doesn't create a message which validates
with the initial <spanx style="verb">mi=1</spanx> hash, then some hop has corrupted the message.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security"><name>Security</name>

<t>Since a Message-Instance header can be used to recreate any email content, implementations
need to be aware that this could be used to bypass security checks, and passing the
generated message to a parser could expose it to content that would otherwise be blocked
by earlier security checks, e.g. the base64 output could generate 8-bit content or NULL
bytes that would otherwise be blocked by a simple filter.</t>

</section>

    <abstract>
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.</t>
      <t>IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently; setting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231; searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.</t>
      <t>IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in RFC 6409.</t>
