=head1 NAME

Mail::DKIM2::TagValueList - The tag=value list a DKIM2 header is made of

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mail::DKIM2::TagValueList;

    my $tvl = Mail::DKIM2::TagValueList->parse("i=1; d=example.com");
    say $tvl->get_tag('d');   # "example.com"

    $tvl->set_tag('t', time);
    say $tvl->as_string;      # "i=1; d=example.com; t=1740000000"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A semicolon-separated list of C<tag=value> pairs (spec-06 section 2.12 and
8). Tag names keep their original case and order, and values their
internal whitespace; serialisation joins C<name=value> pairs with C<; >, so
the whitespace around C<=> and C<;> and a trailing C<;> are normalised
(harmless for signing input, which section 9.6 strips of all whitespace).
Lookups are case-insensitive. L<Mail::DKIM2::Signature> is a subclass.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new()

An empty list.

=head2 parse($string)

Parses a list into a new object (also when called on an existing one),
trimming whitespace around names and values. A tag given twice (in any
case) is reported by C<duplicate_tag>, and a field that is not a valid tag
list by C<syntax_error>; the verifier rejects either.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_tag($name)

The value of the tag, matched case-insensitively, or undef.

=head2 set_tag($name, $value)

Sets a tag, appending it to the order if new.

=head2 duplicate_tag()

The lowercased name of a tag that appeared more than once in the parsed
input, or undef. Section 8 allows one of each; the Verifier reports a
repeat as a permerror.

=head2 syntax_error()

True if the parsed input did not match the tag-list grammar of sections 7
and 8: a non-empty fragment that is not C<name=value>, a name not starting
with a letter, or a value with a character outside printable ASCII or a
C<;>. The well-formed tags are still available, for diagnostics.

=head2 as_string()

The list serialised in its original order, C<"; "> between pairs.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 split_tag_list($string)

Splits a tag list into an arrayref of C<[name, value]> pairs, whitespace
trimmed, and returns it with a flag that is false if any fragment was
malformed: C<my ($pairs, $ok) = split_tag_list($s)>.
